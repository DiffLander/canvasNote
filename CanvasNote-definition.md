# CanvasNote: A Dynamic Canvas for Template-Driven Notes

## Vision

CanvasNote is an infinite, interactive canvas for creating, organizing, and connecting various types of notes. Unlike traditional note-taking applications that constrain users to predefined formats, CanvasNote empowers users with a template-driven architecture where each note can have its own unique rendering, behavior, and interactivity.

The core philosophy is simple: **every note should be able to define not just its content, but its entire presentation and behavior**. This allows the canvas to become a rich ecosystem of diverse note types, each specialized for different tasks and workflows.

## Architecture

CanvasNote employs a modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **CanvasManager**: 
   - Handles canvas transformations (panning, zooming)
   - Manages the viewport state and coordinates
   - Provides scaling and positioning utilities

2. **NoteManager**:
   - Manages the lifecycle of notes (creating, updating, deleting)
   - Maintains the note state (content, position, size)
   - Provides context to other components for note operations

3. **TemplateManager**:
   - Manages template registration and discovery
   - Provides a registry of available templates
   - Serves as the central hub for template-related operations

4. **CustomTemplateRenderer**:
   - Delegates rendering responsibility to individual templates
   - Handles the core note container (dragging, resizing)
   - Connects notes with their template-specific behaviors

5. **TemplateBrowser**:
   - Provides a visual interface for browsing available templates
   - Enables drag-and-drop functionality for adding templates to the canvas
   - Offers quick access to template creation

### Key Concepts

#### Template-Driven Architecture

Each template in CanvasNote defines:
- Its own rendering logic
- Custom controls and behaviors
- Default styling and appearance
- Event handling
- Special interactions

This approach offloads complexity from the core application to the individual templates, making the system more maintainable and extensible.

#### Template Registry

Templates are registered with the application through a centralized registry, allowing for:
- Dynamic discovery of available templates
- Easy addition of new templates
- Template categorization and organization
- Consistent template metadata

#### Context Providers

The application uses React Context Providers to:
- Share state between components without prop drilling
- Provide access to template and note operations
- Enable components to interact with the canvas
- Maintain clean component boundaries

## Template System

Templates are the heart of CanvasNote. Each template is responsible for defining how a note appears and behaves.

### Template Structure

A template consists of:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the template
- **Name**: User-friendly name
- **Renderer**: Custom component for rendering the note
- **Default Size**: Initial dimensions
- **Default Content**: Starting content
- **Behaviors**: Configuration for dragging, resizing, etc.
- **Custom Controls**: Special UI elements for the template
- **Handlers**: Event handlers for template-specific interactions
- **Styles**: Visual appearance settings

### Template Implementation

Templates can be implemented in several ways:
- **React Components**: Using JSX and React patterns
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Using the template editor for less technical users
- **Custom Renderers**: For specialized visualizations or interactions

### Sample Templates

1. **Code Note**: For code snippets with syntax highlighting and execution
2. **Task List**: For to-do lists with checkboxes and completion tracking
3. **Markdown Note**: For rich text with markdown formatting
4. **Whiteboard**: For freehand drawing and sketching
5. **Calculator**: For interactive calculations
6. **Media Note**: For embedding videos, images, and other media

## User Experience

### Canvas Interaction

- **Infinite Canvas**: Pan and zoom to navigate the space
- **Contextual Operations**: Right-click menu for canvas-level actions
- **Drag and Drop**: Add templates by dragging from the browser

### Note Manipulation

- **Move**: Drag notes to position them
- **Resize**: Adjust note dimensions
- **Edit**: Modify note content in-place
- **Connect**: Create visual relationships between notes (future feature)

### Template Browser

- **Visual Selection**: Browse templates with visual previews
- **Categories**: Organize templates by type or purpose
- **Search**: Find specific templates
- **Create**: Design new templates with the template editor

## Extensibility

CanvasNote is designed for extensibility:

- **Plugin System**: Add new functionality without modifying core code
- **Custom Templates**: Create specialized note types for specific tasks
- **API Access**: Connect templates to external services and data sources
- **Import/Export**: Share templates and notes with other users

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: React for component-based UI
- **State Management**: React Context API for shared state
- **Interactions**: React-draggable and React-resizable for note manipulation
- **Canvas Transformations**: react-zoom-pan-pinch for canvas navigation
- **Unique IDs**: UUID for generating unique identifiers

## Future Directions

- **Template Marketplace**: Community sharing of templates
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing
- **Advanced Connections**: Flowchart-like connections between notes
- **AI Integration**: Smart templates with AI capabilities
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design for mobile devices
